# Features for Small Businesses

This document outlines three valuable features designed for small businesses, leveraging the capabilities of the Insurance Policy Analyzer platform.

## 1. Business Risk Exposure & Coverage Adequacy Check

*   **Description:** Small business owners can upload their current insurance policies (e.g., Business Owner's Policy (BOP), Commercial General Liability, Professional Liability, Workers' Compensation). The system analyzes these policies and, based on the business's industry, size, operations (which the user would input or the system might infer), and common risks associated with that profile, it provides a report on potential risk exposures. This report will highlight if their current coverage is adequate for common industry-specific risks, identify potential gaps (e.g., no cyber liability insurance for an e-commerce business, insufficient business interruption coverage), and explain these risks in plain language. It can also compare their coverage limits against typical benchmarks for similar businesses.
*   **Value to Small Business:** Empowers small business owners, who often lack dedicated risk managers, to better understand their insurance needs and potential vulnerabilities. It helps them make more informed decisions when purchasing or renewing insurance, potentially preventing financially crippling uncovered claims. This feature acts as a preliminary risk assessment tool, tailored to their specific business context.
*   **Platform Leverage:** Utilizes the core policy analysis engine, benchmark data (which would need tobe curated for various business types/sizes), and risk identification algorithms. It would require a module for inputting or inferring business profile information.

## 2. Contractual Insurance Requirement Reviewer

*   **Description:** Small businesses often sign contracts with clients, vendors, or landlords that stipulate specific insurance requirements (e.g., minimum liability limits, additional insured endorsements, specific policy types). This feature allows a business owner to upload such a contract (or the relevant insurance clauses section). The system will use NLP to extract the insurance requirements from the contract. It will then compare these requirements against the business's currently uploaded and analyzed insurance policies to flag any discrepancies, shortfalls, or areas where their existing coverage does not meet the contractual obligations. The output would be a clear report showing each contractual requirement, whether their current policy meets it, and where gaps exist.
*   **Value to Small Business:** Saves significant time and potential legal fees by automating the tedious and critical process of reviewing contractual insurance obligations. It helps businesses avoid non-compliance with contracts, which could lead to disputes, loss of business, or uncovered liabilities. This feature is particularly valuable for businesses that frequently enter into new contracts.
*   **Platform Leverage:** This requires advanced NLP capabilities for contract clause extraction and interpretation, in addition to the existing policy analysis engine for comparison. It would involve building a knowledge base of common insurance clauses and their meanings.

## 3. Simplified Claims Process Preparer & Documentation Organizer

*   **Description:** When a small business needs to file a claim, this feature helps them prepare by guiding them through the initial steps. Based on the type of claim (e.g., property damage, liability, cyber incident) and the relevant analyzed policy, the system provides a checklist of information and documentation typically required by insurers for that type of claim. It can also help identify which of their policies is most likely to cover the incident. Furthermore, it allows the business to securely upload and organize relevant documents related to the incident (photos, invoices, police reports, communications) in one place, creating a preliminary claim package. The system can also extract key information from the relevant policy such as the policy number, insurer contact details for claims, and applicable deductibles.
*   **Value to Small Business:** Demystifies the initial stages of the claims process, which can be stressful and confusing for business owners. It helps ensure they gather necessary information promptly, potentially speeding up the claim handling process and improving the chances of a successful claim outcome. It provides a structured way to organize claim-related documentation, reducing administrative burden during a difficult time.
*   **Platform Leverage:** Leverages the analyzed policy data to provide context-specific guidance. It would require a claims knowledge base (common requirements by claim type) and secure document management capabilities. It does not file the claim but prepares the business to do so effectively.
