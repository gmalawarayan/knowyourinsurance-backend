# Insurance Policy Analysis AI Backend Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture for an AI-powered insurance policy analysis system similar to ChatPDF but specifically tailored for insurance policy documents. The system will allow users to upload insurance policy documents, extract key information, and query the documents using natural language.

## System Components

### 1. Document Processing Pipeline
- **PDF Extraction Layer**: Extracts text and structure from uploaded insurance policy PDFs
- **Document Chunking**: Splits documents into manageable chunks for processing
- **Text Cleaning & Normalization**: Prepares text for embedding and analysis
- **Insurance-Specific Entity Recognition**: Identifies policy-specific entities (coverage limits, deductibles, etc.)

### 2. Vector Database Integration
- **Embedding Generation**: Converts text chunks to vector embeddings
- **Vector Storage**: Stores embeddings with metadata in a vector database
- **Similarity Search**: Enables semantic search across policy documents

### 3. LLM Query System
- **Query Processing**: Analyzes and reformulates user questions
- **Context Retrieval**: Fetches relevant document chunks based on query
- **Response Generation**: Generates answers using retrieved context
- **Citation Tracking**: Links responses to source sections in the document

### 4. Insurance-Specific Analysis Features
- **Coverage Gap Detection**: Identifies missing or inadequate coverage
- **Policy Comparison**: Compares different policies or against benchmarks
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluates policy against common risk factors
- **Premium Analysis**: Analyzes cost-effectiveness of coverage

### 5. API Layer
- **Document Upload API**: Handles document submission and processing
- **Query API**: Processes natural language queries and returns responses
- **Analysis API**: Provides access to specialized insurance analysis features

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Framework**: Python with FastAPI for backend services
- **Document Processing**: PyMuPDF/pdfplumber for PDF extraction
- **Vector Database**: Chroma DB (lightweight, easy to integrate)
- **Embedding Model**: Sentence Transformers or OpenAI embeddings
- **LLM Integration**: Support for both API-based (OpenAI) and local models (Ollama)
- **RAG Framework**: LangChain for orchestrating the retrieval-augmented generation pipeline

### Development Tools
- **Environment Management**: Poetry for dependency management
- **Testing**: Pytest for unit and integration testing
- **Documentation**: Sphinx for API documentation

## Data Flow

1. **Document Ingestion**:
   - User uploads insurance policy document
   - System extracts text and structure
   - Document is chunked and processed
   - Chunks are embedded and stored in vector database

2. **Query Processing**:
   - User submits natural language query
   - System analyzes query intent
   - Relevant chunks are retrieved from vector database
   - LLM generates response using retrieved context
   - Response is returned to user with citations

3. **Insurance Analysis**:
   - System extracts key policy elements (coverage, limits, exclusions)
   - Analysis modules process extracted information
   - Results are presented to user in structured format

## Deployment Considerations

- **Scalability**: Design for horizontal scaling of document processing
- **Privacy**: Implement document isolation and secure storage
- **Performance**: Optimize for low-latency query responses
- **Cost Efficiency**: Balance between API usage and local processing

## Extension Points

- **Multi-Modal Support**: Add capability to process policy images
- **Multi-Language Support**: Extend to handle policies in different languages
- **Integration APIs**: Provide hooks for integration with insurance management systems
- **Custom Analysis Plugins**: Allow for domain-specific analysis modules
